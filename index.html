	<h2>PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT</h2>
	<p><strong>Background and Overview</strong></p>
	<p>When I decided to major in art history and minor in Studio Art, I did not know what I wanted my career to be, but I knew that I wanted art to be at the center. Cataloging and processing collections after graduation revealed an opportunity to channel this love of art history into a meaningful career. My first exposure to archives was as an undergraduate student intern with the Patton Archive Project, where I entered metadata about a series of personal diaries into the archive’s online database. After graduation, I was the Principal Cataloger of 17th Century artifacts collected at the Smithsonian Environmental Archeology Lab in Edgewater, Maryland. After moving to Los Angeles, I helped manage collections at Royale Projects Contemporary Art Gallery as the Lead Intern. It was my experience inventorying and rehousing a private family collection belonging to the Franklin K. Lane Estate that convinced me to pursue a graduate degree in Library and Information Studies so that I could refine my practice and expand my skillset.</p>
	<p> My MLIS at UCLA has focused my goals even further. I am developing skills in data management and digital tools because I want help lead the movement not only to provide better access to collections, but to think creatively about how metadata and its presentation can reveal and communicate complex narratives about cultural heritage.</p>
	<p><strong>Metadata and Access</strong></p>
	<p>When my summer, 2020 internship with Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park was changed to a remote position, I needed to quickly shift the focus of my work. Using the final assignment for the spring Metadata course, I decided to design a metadata enhancement project for SEKI digital collections which were being aggregated with Calisphere and the California Consortium of Herbaria. During my internship, I facilitated the harvesting of three digital collections of historic images onto Calisphere and prepared suggestions for future clarification of the collection metadata. Using OpenRefine, I cleaned legacy herbology data collected by scientists at SEKI to prepare them for publication on the California Consortium of Herbaria website. I collaborated with Ward Eldredge, the curator of collections, SEKI herbology scientists and data repository staff, and the liaison from CCH to write suggestions for implementing the new system into SEKI data workflows.</p>
	<p>This project reinforced the importance of metadata in providing access to online collections. I continued to consider this connection during an inter-disciplinary course discussing African Objects in Museums. Building off questions regarding equitable access to museums and transparency in museum practice raised in a Museums in the Digital Age course during fall quarter, I decided to create a digital exhibit using ArcGIS Story Maps which clarified provenance metadata for a Kongo power figure in the Wellcome Collection at the Fowler Museum.</p>
	<p><strong>Humanities Data Management</strong></p>
	<p>During a Digital Preservation course taken winter quarter, 2019, I was part of a group project that worked with a PhD researcher in the Cesar E Chavez Department of Chicana/o Central American Studies who needed to manage a growing collection of digital and digitized Latinx Punk materials. In researching guidelines about managing humanities research data, I found that there were relatively few resources compared to the scientific community. An interview with Maureen Russell, the archivist at the UCLA Ethnomusicology Archive, brought my attention to ethnomusicology data as a case study. I continued to investigate the advantages and challenges of sharing and reusing humanities research data during a spring, 2020 Data Curation and Policy course and an independent research project in fall, 2020 where I used the Data Curation Profile interview as a loose template to interview ethnomusicology researchers. The sensitive nature of cultural data collected by these researchers reinforced the importance of ensuring its preservation, providing responsible access, and collecting careful metadata about cultural guidelines for reuse. It also reinforced the growing necessity for better guidance on managing humanities research data from the beginning of its lifecycle.</p>
	<p><strong>Archival Appraisal and Accession</strong></p>
	<p>Spring quarter, 2021, I will be assisting in an appraisal of a private family collection to determine items for donation. I plan to complete an appraisal report under the guidance of Susan Anderson, the History Curator at the California African American Museum and in conjunction with the Archival Appraisal course taught by Anne Gilliland. I am also assisting Los Angeles Contemporary Archive develop an Accession form for donations received.</p>
	<p>In these and other projects, I will be considering how archival processes can prioritize the needs and voices of communities and the creators of collections over the needs and voice of the archivist.</p>
	<p><strong>Digital and Physical Preservation</strong></p>
	<p>I enrolled in Environmental Protection of Collections and Digital Preservation to gain knowledge of collection preservation. During Environmental Protection of Collections, I prepared a report for the Music Library with recommendations for a Collaborative Preservation Policy. The final project for the course consisted of regularly monitoring temperature and humidity, UV exposure, Insect presence, and acidity in one section of the Music Library and preparing recommendations for improving collection storage conditions. I participated in the Digital Preservation course winter quarter, 2020 and this spring, I am enrolled in the Digital Asset Management course, where I hope to learn more about best practices for managing digital collections.</p>
	<p><strong>Communication and Mentorship</strong></p>
	<p>Before beginning the MLIS program, I had managed the collections of historical figures, archeologists, contemporary artists, and chefs. During my MLIS, I have worked with ethnomusicologists, herbology researchers, art historians, and anthropologists. Learning to translate the conventions of Library and Information Studies into different disciplinary languages has also prepared me to work with community members on archival projects. As an independent archivist, I have worked with two different families hoping to organize and donate personal collections. I have learned how to listen carefully to the needs and concerns of community members and to ensure they are honored in every aspect of my archival work.</p>
	<p>I believe mentorship is important and have sought opportunities to learn and grow through relationships with supervisors and more senior professionals. I have also gained experience as a mentor both through leading a team of interns at Royale Projects and employment as a TA and Reader at UCLA. In these experiences, I have learned how to teach skills in a sustainable way and to be attentive to the needs of students beyond the internship or course. In my career, I will continue to seek out mentorship. I also plan to help the next generation of professionals in the same way that others have helped me.</p>
	<p><strong>Future Development</strong></p>
	<p>There is an opportunity for leadership in shaping how emerging humanities data is managed and preserved for the future. To better aid researchers collecting digital materials and data and to be a part of the growing conversation, I have sought out opportunities to improve my data literacy. I attended Library Carpentry workshops on Tidy Data, OpenRefine, Unix Shell, Python, and using Python for API’s. I assisted with an Institute for Society and Genetics, Data in and of a Pandemic course, taught by Michael Scroggins, who is also a member of the UCLA Center for Knowledge Infrastructures group. The course investigated issues in data collection and communication as they relate to public health. I plan to continue learning about data visualization and analysis tools uniquely suited for humanities data. I have also become a member of the Research Data Access and Preservation Association and have been completing the Research Data Management Librarian Academy online training course.</p>
	<p>Museums are beginning to consider how better access to their collections can foster knowledge creation about broader movements in cultural history and enable better transparency about their practice. Digital tools and metadata are allowing overlooked histories to come to light. Through continuing to build my knowledge of metadata standards in the digital age and best practices in managing, sharing, and visualizing data, I hope to help lead the archival and museum professions in taking part in this new era in a way that is innovative, ethical, and sustainable.</p>

	<h2>ISSUE PAPER</h2>
	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>I am interested in how the call for open access and increasing volumes of digital content affect the way that humanities researchers collect material associated with their research, share it, and deposit it into a collection. My issue paper focuses specifically on ethnomusicology data, which has a long history of being shared via archives. I explore how archives and researchers can develop ways for ethnomusicologists to take advantage of new concepts and technologies without over-simplifying the complex issues of intellectual property and access.</p>

	<h2>MAJOR PAPER</h2>
	<h3>ART MUSEUM COLLECTION PROVENANCE AS DATA</h3>
	<p>Winter 2021<br>
	IS 438B Archival Description and Access<br>
	Professor Jonathan Furner</p>
	<p>Prompt: For this assignment, you will write a final paper on an issue in archival informatics. The topic of your paper should be some issue or research question that is currently attracting interest in the field and/or profession</p>
	<h3>Abstract</h3>
	<p>Art museums have recently been making not only their collections digital, but their provenance data available as datasets. Behind this change is the intersection of several different movements including a more critical museology, the rise in provenance research, the open access movement, and the development of digital art history. Most of the museums who have actively taken part in this work are major institutions with large staffs and impressive budgets. While the decision of whether to
	publish provenance data is a political one, it is also a practical one: the labor necessary to prepare machine-readable datasets from archival records is intimidating and not all museums may have the resources necessary to take this on. Museums are at a moment of change, and in many ways the practice of publishing collections data represents an opportunity to fully embrace this change. This paper explains why some feel this work is necessary, the political factors museums face in deciding to participate, and the practical barriers that make this work so challenging. While the call is for all museums to publish collections data more broadly, this paper focuses on art museums and provenance data specifically. Digital art history is a growing field that relies on the publication of art museum collection data, and most often provenance data. As a discipline, it seeks to address some of the same challenges that museums are facing in trying to build a practice that reflects the issues and priorities of the twenty first Century. The paper proposes that the answer to many of the challenges museums face in publishing provenance data and meeting changes in their role can be addressed through active partnerships with digital art historians as stakeholders in this work.</p>

	<h2>ELECTIVE WORK</h2>
	<h3>SUGGESTIONS FOR METADATA CLEANING FOR SEQUOIA AND KINGS CANYON ROBERTS AND HISTORIC COLLECTIONS</h3>
	<p>Spring 2020<br>
	IS 464 Metadata<br>
	Professor Melissa Gil</p>
	<p>Prompt: For your final assignment, create a comprehensive metadata strategy for a digital resource with a focus on serving your end-users that maps and remediates metadata from at least two collections or repositories.</p>
	<p>Your assignment must address the following: Collections and repositories, intended users and provide an example use case, a simple conceptual data model, an example of a resource description issue, identify controlled vocabularies to be used, metadata schema to be used, how your resources will be discoverable, rights metadata issues (if relevant), whether or not you will use crowdsourcing or machine learning to enhance meatadata, search and browse functionalities, workflow and project management</p>
	<h3>Abstract</h3>
	<p>Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park (referred to here as SEKI) has several digitized and digital collections of images, which it has stored and made available through the NP Gallery portal. NP Gallery is a digital asset management system that was designed to aggregate digital and digitized collections from the National Parks. SEKI has four digitized collections which it has made available or will make available through NP Gallery: The Roberts Collection, Historic Images, Resource Management Slides, and Civilian Conservation Corps. For the purposes of this project, I will be focusing on the Roberts Collection and Historic Images. Initial metadata creation for these collections on NP Gallery was done by a small staff with limited time, thus metadata for these collections succumbs to “Lag”: The dissemination of metadata is not necessarily synchronized with the dissemination of the object to which it applies. NP Gallery uses a local schema for metadata terms and
	arrangement. SEKI’s use of these terms is not consistent and should be clarified and standardized across collections. Description of objects within these elements is often incomplete, with vital information about the contents of photographs or their date of creation absent. SEKI would like to increase the discoverability of its collections by allowing California Digital Library to harvest it and include it in Calisphere. Before this process can be completed, metadata must be cleaned and enhanced both to help with the harvesting process and to increase access and discoverability both in NP Gallery and on Calisphere.</p>

	<h3>CLARIFYING PROVENANCE</h3>
	<p>Winter 2021<br>
	IS 596<br>
	Professor Ellen Pearlstein, Professor Andrew Apter, Professor Allen Roberts, Professor Glenn Wharton</p>
	<p>Prompt: All over the world, museums are reflecting on how to make collections of African objects more relevant to their audiences. An interdisciplinary cohort of graduate students from Anthropology, Conservation, History, Information Studies, and World Arts and Cultures joined together in fall 2020 to each select an object from digital images provided from the Henry Wellcome Collection of African objects from the Fowler Museum. Students will submit an independent research proposal at the end of fall 2020. Students submitted a revised research proposal at the end of winter 2021.</p>
	<h3>Abstract</h3>
	<p>My project was inspired by digitized museum collections and the ways they enable new methods for investigating those collections, providing access to them, and presenting information about them. I am also interested in how provenance research connects to methods to decolonize museums. Along with making their collections more accessible through digitization, publishing information about the provenance of these collections is an opportunity for museums to engage with their association with colonial systems and motives for collecting and displaying non-Western objects. I wanted to use the StoryMaps tool to present my research because it is one of the many digital platforms that allow museums and scholars to visualize and communicate complicated collections data. I also wanted to center my project around the “map” as a way to visualize this figure’s provenance “data” in a way that is more immediate: seeing its various locations as points on a map better emphasizes the global network surrounding the trade and display of African objects.</p>

	<h2>CORE WORK</h2>
	<h3>DROPBOX TECHNOLOGY REPORT</h3>
	<p>Winter 2020<br>
	IS 270<br>
	Professor Miriam Posner</p>
	<p>Prompt: Because of the rapid pace of evolution of information technologies, it is important to identify ways in which you can keep your skills fresh. This course will help you to identify, access and use resources for keeping up-to-date with the field of information technology, through writing a 4-page policy brief. The brief will be addressed to campus leaders, e.g., members of the UCLA Information Technology Planning Board, or University Librarian Virginia Steele, or Faculty Senate Chair Joseph Bristow, regarding technologies that might be adopted on campus or, more broadly, have an impact on the future of higher education, or on the university as a place where student, staff, and faculty spend considerable time.</p>
	<h3>Abstract</h3>
	<p>I would like to use the Final Project as an opportunity to explore cloud based storage services. I believe that this is a technology that is relevant both personally and professionally. Most of the public understands the importance of storing digital information in a secure location, accessible by multiple people and across multiple devices, which is why many have turned to services like Dropbox for storing important records. Cloud based storage also answers the call for redundancy- ensuring the life of data is not determined by the durability of one hardware. In considering the longevity of data, accessibility and open source capabilities and the privacy and security of information, I want to explore what the trade offs are for storing data through a cloud system. Many businesses and individuals use these services for their convenience, assuming that their data is secure and that they will continue to have long-term access to it. I want to understand the extent to which this is true and examine whether there are better, more secure options available.</p>
	<p> I am also including four shorter assignments written for the course investigating the infrastructure, architecture, standards, and issues of privacy and equity involved in the operation of Dropbox.</p>
