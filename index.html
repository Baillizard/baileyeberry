	<h2>Issue Paper</h2>
	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>I am interested in how the call for open access and increasing volumes of digital content affect the way that humanities researchers collect material associated with their research, share it, and deposit it into a collection. My issue paper focuses specifically on ethnomusicology data, which has a long history of being shared via archives. I explore how archives and researchers can develop ways for ethnomusicologists to take advantage of new concepts and technologies without over-simplifying the complex issues of intellectual property and access.</p>

	<h3>Art Museum Collection Provenance as Data</h3>
	<p>Winter 2021</p>
	<p>IS 438B Archival Description and Access</p>
	<p>Professor Jonathan Furner</p>
	<p>Prompt: For this assignment, you will write a final paper on an issue in archival informatics. The topic of your paper should be some issue or research question that is currently attracting interest in the field and/or profession</p>
	<h3>Abstract</h3>
	<p>Art museums have recently been making not only their collections digital, but their provenance data available as datasets. Behind this change is the intersection of several different movements including a more critical museology, the rise in provenance research, the open access movement, and the development of digital art history. Most of the museums who have actively taken part in this work are major institutions with large staffs and impressive budgets. While the decision of whether to
	publish provenance data is a political one, it is also a practical one: the labor necessary to prepare machine-readable datasets from archival records is intimidating and not all museums may have the resources necessary to take this on. Museums are at a moment of change, and in many ways the practice of publishing collections data represents an opportunity to fully embrace this change. This paper explains why some feel this work is necessary, the political factors museums face in deciding to participate, and the practical barriers that make this work so challenging. While the call is for all museums to publish collections data more broadly, this paper focuses on art museums and provenance data specifically. Digital art history is a growing field that relies on the publication of art museum collection data, and most often provenance data. As a discipline, it seeks to address some of the same challenges that museums are facing in trying to build a practice that reflects the issues and priorities of the twenty first Century. The paper proposes that the answer to many of the challenges museums face in publishing provenance data and meeting changes in their role can be addressed through active partnerships with digital art historians as stakeholders in this work.</p>

	<h3>Suggestions for Metadata Cleaning for Sequoia and Kings Canyon Roberts and Historic Collections</h3>
	<p>Spring 2020</p>
	<p>IS 464 Metadata</p>
	<p>Professor Melissa Gil</p>
	<p>Prompt: For your final assignment, create a comprehensive metadata strategy for a digital resource with a focus on serving your end-users that maps and remediates metadata from at least two collections or repositories.</p>
	<p>Your assignment must address the following: Collections and repositories, intended users and provide an example use case, a simple conceptual data model, an example of a resource description issue, identify controlled vocabularies to be used, metadata schema to be used, how your resources will be discoverable, rights metadata issues (if relevant), whether or not you will use crowdsourcing or machine learning to enhance meatadata, search and browse functionalities, workflow and project management</p>
	<h3>Abstract</h3>
	<p>Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park (referred to here as SEKI) has several digitized and digital collections of images, which it has stored and made available through the NP Gallery portal. NP Gallery is a digital asset management system that was designed to aggregate digital and digitized collections from the National Parks. SEKI has four digitized collections which it has made available or will make available through NP Gallery: The Roberts Collection, Historic Images, Resource Management Slides, and Civilian Conservation Corps. For the purposes of this project, I will be focusing on the Roberts Collection and Historic Images. Initial metadata creation for these collections on NP Gallery was done by a small staff with limited time, thus metadata for these collections succumbs to “Lag”: The dissemination of metadata is not necessarily synchronized with the dissemination of the object to which it applies. NP Gallery uses a local schema for metadata terms and
	arrangement. SEKI’s use of these terms is not consistent and should be clarified and standardized across collections. Description of objects within these elements is often incomplete, with vital information about the contents of photographs or their date of creation absent. SEKI would like to increase the discoverability of its collections by allowing California Digital Library to harvest it and include it in Calisphere. Before this process can be completed, metadata must be cleaned and enhanced both to help with the harvesting process and to increase access and discoverability both in NP Gallery and on Calisphere.</p>
